            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. Letâ€™s explore more about HTML:</p>
            <p>HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, defining the various elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. It is a key component of the web development stack, serving as the backbone for creating accessible and semantic web content. HTML documents are composed of nested elements, organized in a tree-like structure known as the Document Object Model (DOM), which browsers render into visually appealing web pages.</p>
            <p>Whether you're creating a simple personal website, an e-commerce platform, or a complex web application, HTML forms the foundation upon which the entire web is built.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    HTML was first introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. It is:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Based on a markup syntax: HTML uses tags to define elements and their attributes, allowing developers to structure and style web content.</li>
                        <li>Platform-independent: HTML is supported by all major web browsers and can be used across different operating systems and devices.</li>
                        <li>Extensible: HTML can be extended and enhanced with technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing web experiences.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul><br/>

                        &lt;!-- Define a simple HTML structure --&gt; <br/>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;<br/>
