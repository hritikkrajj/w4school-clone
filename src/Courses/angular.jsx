            <p>Angular is a powerful framework for building single-page web applications. Letâ€™s explore more about Angular:</p>
            <p>Developed and maintained by Google, Angular provides developers with a comprehensive toolkit for building dynamic and interactive web applications. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and offers features such as two-way data binding, dependency injection, and modular component-based development. Angular's declarative templates and powerful CLI (Command Line Interface) streamline the development process, enabling developers to create scalable and maintainable applications with ease.</p>
            <p>Whether you're building enterprise applications, progressive web apps (PWAs), or mobile applications with frameworks like Ionic, Angular offers a robust platform for modern web development.</p>

        Developed by Google in 2010, Angular has gained widespread adoption in the web development community. It is:
        <ul>
            <li>Based on TypeScript: Angular leverages TypeScript's static typing and object-oriented features to enhance developer productivity and code maintainability.</li>
            <li>Component-based: Angular applications are composed of modular, reusable components that encapsulate HTML, CSS, and TypeScript logic.</li>
            <li>Used for building single-page applications (SPAs), progressive web apps (PWAs), and enterprise-scale applications.</li>
